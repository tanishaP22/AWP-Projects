### Features: 
A simple and interactive Kanban-style task manager built. This task manager allows users to create, organize, and manage tasks across three categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to move tasks between lists easily. Tasks are saved locally using localStorage, making the data persistent across page reloads. It is also optimized for mobile devices with a responsive design using Bootstrap.
